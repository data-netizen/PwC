# Bank Marketing Algorithm Enhancement

This project is part of a virtual internship with PwC and aims to enhance a bank's phone marketing algorithm. The primary objective is to develop a classification model to predict whether a specific individual will subscribe to a term deposit. Additionally, the project seeks to analyze and identify the key features or variables that have the greatest influence on the classification outcome. Please note that the main goal of this project is mainly to find the most contributing features to the classification outcome and not to achieve high performance.
